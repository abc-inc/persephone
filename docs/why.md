# Why _Persephone_?

The Neo4j ecosystem has a couple of references to _The Matrix_ franchise e.g., Cypher, Apoc, etc.

Persephone is also a fictional character in _The Matrix_ franchise.
She is a tall intimidating woman with pale skin, black shoulder-length hair, and crimson red lips.
She seems bored with her existence in the Matrix and aids the Resistance.
In the movies, she is portrayed by Monica Bellucci.

Therefore, _Persephone_ is the ideal name for a Neo4j client, which is both,
powerful and visually appealing, and aims to play a big role in the Neo4j ecosystem.
